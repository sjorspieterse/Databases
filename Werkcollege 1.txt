Suppose we have the following scheme for our library database (assuming some simplifications).
Old loan data are preserved. For every book, we only have one occurrence.
BOOK (bno, title, author, publisher)
READER (rno, name, address, city)
LOAN (bno, rno, loan-date, return-date)
Identify candidate keys for each table.
Note that in the case of the Loan table, several solutions are possible, depending on your
considerations with respect to the exact meaning of the table contents and the allowed
operations.
Identify also the foreign keys.

Candidate Key: A candidate key is a key which has a 1 and only 1 principle. 
Example: A book only has 1 book number. A book number applies to only 1 book.

The candidate keys here are:
Book (bno) YES, because a book only has 1 book number. *or anything linked with bno*
Book (title, author)YES, because an author will only have one book with 1 certain title. No two books with the same title.
Reader (rno) YES, because a reader only has one reader number. *or anything linked with rno*
Loan (bno) YES, because a book (with a unique book number) can only be borrowed once.

The foreign keys here are:
Loan (bno), because this directly refers to one and only one book.
Loan (rno), because this directly refers to one and only one reader.
